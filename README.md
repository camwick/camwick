## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Cameron Wickersham

### About me
Currently studying Computer Science, my dream is to be a software engineer that pushes the boundaries of the tech industry. Learning is my passion and I love surrounding myself with new material. Something I really love about this field is that technology is constantly evolving and I wish to be at the forefront of this technological growth.

### Schooling
- Bachelors of Science in Computer Science
- Minor in Applied Mathematics

### My Programming Adventure
I actually started my college career as a mathematics major. I was really interested in teaching math. Math was always my favorite subject in school and was closest with my math teachers. Programming was always in the back of my mind, however. I remember being in middle school and going through the HTML/CSS tutorials on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). I was also playing around in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) quite a lot. After my first semester, I decided I'd rather computer science where I can still apply my love for mathematics. 

Now in my senior year of college, I'll be ready to graduate this coming Fall 2022. My academic studies have focused in Java and C++ while also sprinkling in a little C, R, Matlab, and Python. Java is definitely my favorite language to work with, but thanks to my studies, I can apply my knowledge of data structures and algorithms to practically every language. I like how once you know one language, all you really need to do to learn a new language is understand the syntax and the nuances of the language. 

### Leadership Positions
I've had the pleasure of leading a project for the [PNW Computer Science Club](https://github.com/PNW-CS-Club). I, along with about 3 more active students, built a [Minesweeper Solver](https://github.com/PNW-CS-Club/Minesweeper-Bot). The goal of this bot was to solve no-guess minesweeper boards. The no-guess category in minesweeper means that there is always a logical solution to the puzzle; meaning you'll never have to guess. We use the color of the pixels on the screen to identify what the minesweeper board looks like and automatically move and click the computer mouse to solve the board. The user only has to select the proper board settings and press "Solve". 

The beginning of the solve takes a little bit of time due to a heuristic method of finding the minesweeper puzzle. The solver is calibrating the top left corner of the board so that our search algorithm can properly find the center of every cell. We utilize several ideas from our studies like linked lists, depth first search, and graphs to help solve the board. 

We are currently working on version of this project that will use a WebDriver Browser to read the DOM to get the cell data. This would completely eliminate the awkward calibration time at the start of the solve.
